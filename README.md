# QC_Datasets
**Relevancy QC** and **Correctness_QC** are two custom datasets created from a existing Bangla Reading Comprehension based Question Answering dataset named *"UDDIPOK"* containing 2603 and 3581 data instances respectively. Both the datasets are balanced and contain 3 features named *"Context"*, *"Question"* and *"Label"*. The features are as follows:

* Context: a string feature.
* Question: a string feature.
* Label: a string feature
  
These datasets were used to create Two Classification models that can evaluate Grammatical correctness and Relevancy of the generated questions from a given context in the following [journal article](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44227-023-00018-5). They can also be used for different research purpose in the domain of Bangla NLP.
